# ðŸªŸ windows-clone
This is just a small clone of Windows 11 that I am currently working on for fun.
It doesn't have a lot currently, only the taskbar for now, since I have just started this project

## ðŸ§© notice
I will not be adding support for mobile, and I will not frequently be updating this repository. This is just a side-project that I am doing for fun since I felt like it. Maybe it'll become something cool in the future.
